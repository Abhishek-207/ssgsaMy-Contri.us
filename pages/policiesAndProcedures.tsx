                organisation, annually administers the Sir Syed Global Scholar
                Award &#40;SSGSA&#41;. SSGSA, formerly known as the Sir Syed
                Excellence in Science Award &#40;SSESA&#41;, is a merit-based
                scholarship that is awarded to academically outstanding students
                from all faculties at the Aligarh Muslim University. All
                donations and contributions directly sponsor the attempts of
                talented students to secure admission in MS/Ph.D programs at
                centers/universities of international repute. SSGSA supports
                each scholar in achieving their full potential, as outlined
                below:

                  SSGSA scholars are selected on the basis of rigorous review of
                  their application by independent academic experts and personal
                  interview to assess knowledge and motivation.

                  A committed team of mentors work with the scholars on every
                  aspect of their preparation and application. The mentors
                  continue to be available for guidance and help throughout the
                  academic journey of the scholars, and in many cases well into
                  their professional careers.

                There are three main parts of expenditure incurred by
                prospective applicants. GRE/GMAT and TOEFL/IELTS, mandatory for
                application to most masters and Ph.D. programs in the United
                States, and individual application fee of the university.

                SSGSA helps scholars with financial assistance towards
                standardized test-preparation-materials, standardized tests
                &#40;GRE &amp; TOEFL&#41; and application fees, and personalized
                mentoring throughout the process from selection of universities
                to refining personal essays and resumes.

              <p className="pl-2 sm:px-5 md:px-10">
                SSGSA covers the cost of GRE/GMAT and TOEFL/IELTS entirely, and
                funds the application fee of up to 5 universities. No cash is
                available to the student at any point during the entire
                application procedure. GRE/GMAT, TOEFL/IELTS as well as
                application fees are paid online by the SSGSA operational team.
                In order to ensure serious effort by the students that are
                nominated, we pay for the tests in steps. For example, students
                who get a good score in GRE &#40;over 300, as recommended by
                most universities&#41; will be supported for TOEFL, and students
                who score well in both the tests will be supported for the
                application fees for the universities. Students who don&apos;t
                get good scores will not be supported for the next step. Each
                candidate is supported for only one attempt. Scholars are
                advised to take practice tests and send those scores to our
                mentorship team for evaluation. Based on how they perform in the
                practice tests, a decision on whether to pay for the tests will
                be made.

              <p className="pl-2 sm:px-5 md:px-10">
                Since the existing examination system in India &#40;at the
                bachelor&apos;s and master&apos;s level and the other entrance
                exams for Ph.D.&#41; is entirely different from the TOEFL/IELTS/
                GRE/GMAT pattern, it may not be possible for students to prepare
                well for these tests simultaneously. Hence, the award is valid
                for two years. Applications for the award are invited in the
                first week of February and results are declared by the third
                week of March. The selection is based only on merit.
                Applications from talented students with a proven academic
                record are considered. However, there are certain other criteria
                that the student has to fulfill. The entire application
                procedure entails the following requirements:

                A panel of experts in the respective fields review the contents
                of each application from that discipline. The reviews are done
                independently so that the students get a fair assessment, and
                each application is assigned points on a scale of 1-100. An
                average of these points is used to draw up a merit list and the
                top 20% students are called for a personal interview round.
                About 25-30 students &#40;dependent on available financial
                aid&#41; are awarded SSGSA scholarships each year.

                The award and its benefits are valid for a maximum period of two

                  and for TOEFL at least 90/120 would be the requirement. They
                  will be given a chance to take the exam again AT THEIR OWN
