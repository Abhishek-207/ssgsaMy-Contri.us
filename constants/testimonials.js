      'Everyone at SSGSA was extremely supportive. When I joined SSGSA, I \
      felt that I did not know how to present my accomplishments and talents \
      properly. I feel medicos often have difficulties in doing so, and for \
      me, even making a resume seemed like a gargantuan task. Furthermore, at \
      the time, no one from SSGSA had pursued Masters in Public Health, which \
      was the field in which I wanted to specialize. There were significant \
      obstacles to overcome, but the senior figures at SSGSA, in particular, \
      Rehan Bhai, Saif Bhai, Rizvi Bhai, Mohsin Bhai and my friends, Ali \
      Muzaffar and Afzal Shadab guided me throughout my journey. They advised \
      me on approaching the application process in the right way and helped \
      me improve my presentation skills.',

      beyond our imagination. I am grateful to the SSGSA family for \
      everything they did for me. I truly owe this great organization a lot. \
      If ever given a chance I would love to contribute to taking this \
      organization to the pinnacle of excellence. To all my friends who are \
      really passionate about studying abroad, I must tell you that this \
      opportunity is worth your long tiring hours of endeavor and sleepless \
      nights. Get up and grab it.',

      beginning of my pursuit of higher education. I am extremely thankful to \
      the SSGSA team members who guided and helped me.  I had the privilege \
      of getting multiple PhD offers from the US and Europe. It was getting \
      difficult for me to choose the right one. Finally, my mentors and other \
      SSGSA members helped me to choose the best one.',

      'In my opinion, it is the feeling of possibility that the SSGSA program \
      brings to your perspective as an aspiring graduate course applicant. \
      The lack of physicality, the tangibility of an institution a student \
      aspires to be a part of is a major impediment to imagining \
      possibilities; it is the space where a human mind (applicant in this \
      case) generally struggles and SSGSA, in my opinion, does a great job to \
      fill that chasm of impossibility.',

      and I had applied to eight universities of which I got admits from \
      four. They (SSESA members) helped me to write my resume, to edit my SOP \
      apart from helping financially. Most importantly, they kept me \
      motivated throughout the application process',
